TESTING
========

-basic encryption user input
-basic decryption user input
-basic encryption file input
-basic decryption file input

-check diffusion:
    -slightly change plaintext input
        -user input
        -file input
    -significantly change plaintext input
        -user input
        -file input
-check confusion
    -slightly change key
    -significantly change key



REPORT
======
-diffusion
    -did a slight change in the plaintext input make a big change in the ciphertext? (before vs after)
        -do a character distribution analysis before and after (graph them)
            -descirbe the before and after graphs (not as a critique)
            -point out any good or bad characteristics of the change (critique it)
    -is this a good result or bad? why? (restate the characteristics of the graphs)
        -could we realeastically use this cryptographic protocol?
    -compare the difference in graphs to changes in other cryptographic techniques: (graph before vs after ea.)
        -caesar cipher
        -transpositional cipher
        -OTP
        -ver-asdf-cryptographic protocol
    -how could we improve diffusion?
        -use modes?
        -use subkeys?
        -use a combination of cryptographic techniques?
            -add caesar?
            -add transpositional?
            -add OTP?
            -add ver-sdflkkj?
-confusion
    -did a slight change in the key make a big change in the ciphertext?
        -do a character distribution analysis before and after
            -descirbe the before and after graphs (not as a critique)
            -point out any good or bad characteristics of the change (critique it)
    -repeat from diffsion
        -are the results good?
        -compare to other cryptographic techniques, graph em
        -how could we improve confusion?


-CBC diffusion/confusion
    -can a cryptoanalyst notice the IV?
        -do multiple tests and check the first block for repeating patterns
